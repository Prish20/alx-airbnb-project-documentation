# Airbnb Clone Backend Features and Functionalities

## Introduction

The Airbnb Clone backend is designed to support a rental marketplace that enables users to register as guests or hosts, manage property listings, search and filter available properties, handle bookings, process payments, manage reviews, and provide a user-friendly interface for both hosts and guests. This document outlines the core features, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements of the backend system.

### Core Functionalities

#### 1. User Management

* **User Registration:** Users can sign up as guests or hosts using secure authentication methods like JWT.
* **User Login and Authentication:** Supports email and password login, with OAuth integration (Google, Facebook).
* **Profile Management:** Allows users to update profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

#### 2. Property Listings Management

* **Add Listings:** Hosts can create property listings, including details like title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
* **Edit/Delete Listings:** Hosts can update or remove existing property listings.

#### 3. Search and Filtering

* Search properties based on location, price range, number of guests, and amenities.
* Supports pagination for large datasets.

#### 4. Booking Management

* **Booking Creation:** Guests can book properties for specific dates, preventing double bookings.
* **Booking Cancellation:** Allows guests and hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
* **Booking Status:** Track statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

#### 5. Payment Integration

* Uses secure payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
* Supports upfront payments and automatic payouts after booking completion.
* Multi-currency support.

#### 6. Reviews and Ratings

* Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* Hosts can respond to reviews.
* Reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

#### 7. Notifications System

* Email and in-app notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.

#### 8. Admin Dashboard

* Provides monitoring and management for users, listings, bookings, and payments.

### Technical Requirements

#### 1. Database Management

* Use PostgreSQL for relational data management.
* Include tables for Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.

#### 2. API Development

* RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE.
* Optionally use GraphQL for complex data fetching.

#### 3. Authentication and Authorization

* Implement secure user sessions using JWT.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

#### 4. File Storage

* Use AWS S3 or Cloudinary for storing property images and profile photos.

#### 5. Third-Party Services

* Integrate SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

#### 6. Error Handling and Logging

* Implement global error handling for API responses.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Scalability

* Modular architecture for horizontal scaling.
* Use load balancers to manage increased traffic.

#### 2. Security

* Secure sensitive data with encryption.
* Implement firewalls and rate limiting.

#### 3. Performance Optimization

* Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
* Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

#### 4. Testing

* Implement unit and integration tests with frameworks like pytest.
* Automated API testing for endpoint validation.
